# Airbnb Clone Data Flow Diagram

## Overview
This data flow diagram (DFD) illustrates how data moves through the Airbnb Clone system. It visualizes the relationships between external entities, processes, data stores, and data flows within the application.

## Diagram Components

### External Entities
- **Guest Users**: Users who search for and book properties
- **Host Users**: Users who list and manage properties
- **Admin Users**: System administrators who manage the platform
- **Payment Gateway**: External payment processing service

### Processes
1. **User Management**: Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management
2. **Property Management**: Processes property listings, updates, and removals
3. **Search & Filter Engine**: Processes search queries and filters results
4. **Booking Management**: Handles the creation, modification, and cancellation of bookings
5. **Review System**: Manages the creation and display of user reviews
6. **Payment Processing**: Handles payment transactions, refunds, and payouts
7. **Notification System**: Generates and sends notifications to users
8. **Admin Dashboard**: Processes administrative tasks and generates reports

### Data Stores
- **Users DB**: Stores user account information and profiles
- **Properties DB**: Stores property listings with details and availability
- **Bookings DB**: Stores booking information and status
- **Reviews DB**: Stores user reviews and ratings
- **Payments DB**: Stores payment transactions and history
- **Notifications DB**: Stores notification templates and history

### Data Flows
The arrows in the diagram represent the flow of data between entities, processes, and data stores. Each flow is labeled to indicate the type of data being transferred.

## How to Read This Diagram
1. External entities (rectangles) represent sources or destinations of data outside the system
2. Processes (circles/rounded rectangles) represent operations performed on data
3. Data stores (open-ended rectangles) represent repositories where data is stored
4. Arrows indicate the direction of data flow

## Usage
This diagram serves as a visual guide for understanding how data flows through the Airbnb Clone system. It is valuable for:
- System architects to understand the overall data architecture
- Developers to understand data dependencies between components
- Database designers to plan database schemas and relationships
- QA testers to ensure all data paths are tested

## Note
This is a high-level data flow diagram that focuses on the major data movements within the system. More detailed diagrams may be created for specific subsystems as needed during implementation.
