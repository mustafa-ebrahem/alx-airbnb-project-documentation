# Airbnb Clone User Stories

## Overview
This directory contains the user stories for the Airbnb Clone project. These user stories translate the use cases from the system interaction diagram into actionable requirements from the perspective of different user types.

## Purpose
User stories are a way to articulate how a specific feature will provide value to a particular user. They help the development team understand the context of why certain features are needed beyond just what needs to be built. Each user story follows the format:

"As a [type of user], I want to [perform some action] so that [achieve some goal/benefit]."

## Contents
The `user-stories.md` file in this directory contains a comprehensive set of user stories covering:

- User Management
- Property Management
- Booking System
- Payment System
- Admin Functions

## Relationship to Other Documentation
These user stories are derived directly from the use cases identified in the use case diagram (located in the `use-case-diagram/` directory). They provide more detail and context for each interaction between users and the system.

## How to Use
The user stories in this documentation should be used to:

1. Guide the development of features and functionality
2. Create acceptance criteria for testing
3. Prioritize development efforts
4. Ensure that all stakeholder needs are being met

## Maintenance
As the project evolves, new user stories may need to be added, or existing ones modified. When making changes, ensure that any new user stories align with the overall system architecture and use cases defined in other documentation.
