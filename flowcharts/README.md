# Airbnb Clone Flowcharts

## Overview
This directory contains flowcharts that visualize key backend processes of the Airbnb Clone project. These flowcharts provide a step-by-step illustration of how data and processes flow through the system for core functionalities.

## Contents
- **Property Booking Process Flowchart**: Visualizes the complete workflow of how a property is booked, from initial search to booking confirmation, including payment processing and notification delivery.

## How to Use These Flowcharts
These flowcharts serve as visual documentation for developers to understand the logic and data flow of key backend processes. They should be used:

1. During planning and development to ensure all steps in the process are accounted for
2. When onboarding new team members to help them understand system workflows
3. As a reference when debugging issues related to these processes
4. To identify potential bottlenecks or areas for optimization

## Diagram Notation
The flowcharts use standard flowchart notation:
- Rectangles: Process steps or actions
- Diamonds: Decision points
- Parallelograms: Data input/output
- Arrows: Flow direction
- Cylinders: Database operations
- Rounded rectangles: Start/End points

## Relationship to Other Documentation
These flowcharts complement the data flow diagrams and use case diagrams by providing a more detailed, step-by-step view of specific processes within the system. While the data flow diagrams show the overall movement of data throughout the entire system, these flowcharts zoom in on individual processes to show their internal steps and logic.
